Evolution of the Syrian war between 2012 and 2018.

Through the python, I used the Folium package and its TimeStampedGeoJSON plugin to create a map of the Syria War between 2012 and 2018. This map can be seen here: https://doctorwho.com.br/projects/syrian_war/

The map shows the evolution of the war every 4 months between January 2012 and January 2018 dividing the Syrian polygon into territories dominated by different political groups.
Several maps were overlaid and more non-cartographic information was added, such as photos and videos before and after the destruction. Some images or videos may have disappeared or changed the link and may not be displayed.
